## Project Objective

**Problem Statement:** Waste misclassification is a persistent issue that contaminates recyclables, increases landfill waste, and reduces recycling efficiency. Many users struggle to sort waste properly due to the lack of real-time guidance and intuitive feedback mechanisms.

**Motivation:** Our main goal was to design a smart waste bin that automatically sorts waste materials while educating its user on how to classify waste items properly. This is why we designed Sota Bin — "State-of-the-Art Sorting for a Sustainable Future." We also addressed the issue of continuous bin monitoring by implementing an automated bin-full detection feature using IR sensors instead of ultrasonic sensors.

**Key Features:**

1. Classifies waste into four categories — landfill, paper, plastic/metal, and compost.
2. Educates users on the classification of items in real-time via a website.
3. Sends alerts when a bin section is full, notifying users and managers.
4. Provides sorting data analytics over time.
5. Allows managers to remotely reset the Sense HAT LED indicator when a bin section is full via the web.

**Key Users:** Everyday users and facility managers in schools, offices, and other public spaces.

## Installation Instructions

### Hardware Setup

- RPi1: Camera, color sensor, IR reflective sensor, metal sensor, LCD display
- RPi2: Stepper motor + A4988 driver, servo motor
- RPi3: IR reflective sensors, Sense HAT
- RPi4: IR reflective sensors, Sense HAT
- Power: 5V USB for RPis, 12V adapter for metal sensor

### Software Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
$ git clone https://github.com/ucheeaa/sota-bin-sysc3010

# Navigate to the appropriate directory (example for RPi1)
$ cd "SOTA BIN MAIN/RPi1"

# Install dependencies (adjust based on your Pi)
$ pip install opencv-python firebase-admin RPi.GPIO sense-hat websocket-client
```
- Add your Firebase `firebase_key.json` to the correct directory (e.g., `RPi1/`, `RPi3/`, etc.)
- Update scripts with your Firebase Realtime Database URL

### Firebase Setup

- Create Firebase project
- Enable Realtime Database
- Download `firebase_key.json` and add to each Pi folder except for RPi2 which doesn't communicate with Firebase

## How to Run the System

1. **RPi1 (Object Classification):**

```bash
cd "SOTA BIN MAIN/RPi1"
python3 classifier_and_commander.py
```
Then in another terminal run: 
```bash
cd "SOTA BIN MAIN/RPi1"
python3 lcd_simulation.py
```

2. **RPi2 (Motor Control):**

```bash
cd "SOTA BIN MAIN/RPi2"
python3 final_motor.py
```

3. **RPi3 (Bin Full Monitoring & Web Interaction):**

```bash
cd "SOTA BIN MAIN/RPi3"
python3 monitor_bins.py
```

4. **RPi4 (Optional Monitoring):**

```bash
cd "SOTA BIN MAIN/RPi4"
python3 bin_full_monitor.py
```

5. **Web Dashboard:**

```bash
cd "SOTA BIN MAIN/RPi3/WEB"
# Open index.html in browser or serve via local server
```

## How to Know It’s Working

- Running SOTA BIN TEST/HARDWARE_TEST and SOTA BIN TEST/SOFTWARE_TEST scripts should pass
  
- LCD screen continuously shows "Place one item at a time."
  
- When waste is placed on plate:
  - Object is detected and classified
  - Classification appears in RPi1 local DB, Firebase and Web UI
  - Servo and stepper motors activate (RPi2) to the appropriate bin section

- When a bin is full:
  - One of the two Sense HATs beems up
  - Web interface alert appears
  - Manager is sent an email

- When reset is clicked (web):
  - Firebase logs the action
  - RPi3 detects it and clears Sense HAT display
